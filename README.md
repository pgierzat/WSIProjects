# WSIProjects
Repository with projects realised during WSI course on sem3

## Topics
1. Comparison of Steepest Descent and Newton-Rapshon's methods in finding minimums of functions.
2. Evolutionary algorithm, problem with placement of anthenas.
3. Minimax in tictactoe
4. Linear regression with L1 and L2 regularization
5. Neural Network, learning to represent a function. Realized in cooperation with colleague
6. Reinforcment learning
7. Bayesian network, MCMC algorithm with Gibbs sampling

Created the algorithms with according reports to each of them.
